  "description": "As an avid \"Foodie\", you eat out _alot_. So much so, in fact, that you have a hard time remembering the details from your previous visits - What did you order? How long did you have to wait to be seated? Were the waistaff friendly and helpful, or rude and dismissive? Was the \"mild\" Panang Curry _really_ mild, or did it burn the tongue out of your mouth? You could lug a notebook and take detailed notes each visit - taking your attention away from why you came in the first place (to experience the meal), or you can leverage FoodieFun and easily record and access all the important details, freeing you up to focus exclusively on the meal. FoodieFun is a feature-rich \"Foodie-Focused\" journaling app designed with the avid \"Foodie\" in mind.
